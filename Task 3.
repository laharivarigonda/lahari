class Employee{
	//save this class name as file name also
	public static void main(String args[]){		//args -variable name-is it mandate??
		// to give clarity on the flow of program		
		System.out.println("hello world"); //print and got to next line
		System.out.print("hello1");
		System.out.print("hello2");	
			}
}

// psvm(args)......we can use any variable name instead of args
// 1. write without arg...
// 2. spvm(args)...if the main() method is written without String args[]..The program will compile, but not run, because JVM will not recognize the main() method.
//JVM always looks for the main() method with a string type array as a parameter. 

// 3. psm(args).....If main method is not void, we will get an error

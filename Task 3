Question 1: The process of compiling and running Java programs using the JDK (Java Development Kit) and JVM (Java Virtual Machine). 

The main things in the JDK AND JVM
 1.Compilation:
   Java source code (.java files) is compiled using the javac compiler, which is part of the JDK.
   The output of compilation is bytecode (.class files), not machine code.
 2.Execution:
   JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes Java bytecode.
   JVM loads .class files into memory through a component called the class loader.
   Bytecode verifier checks the validity of .class files to ensure they are not corrupt or malicious.
   JIT (Just-In-Time) or AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation may be used to optimize performance by converting bytecode to machine code during execution.
   Security Manager ensures the security of the Java runtime environment by enforcing security policies.
 3.Running Java Programs:
   To run a Java program, you need the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), which includes JVM.
   You execute the program using the java command followed by the class name (without the .class extension).


Question 2:  JAVA SE JAVA EE JAVA ME

why it is named as JDK, J2SE, Java SE
 1.JDK (Java Development Kit):
    The JDK is a software development kit used for developing Java applications.
    It includes tools such as the Java compiler (javac), Java runtime environment (java), and various utilities for compiling, debugging, and packaging Java programs.
    The name "JDK" has been used consistently throughout Java's history to denote the kit developers use to build Java applications.
2.J2SE (Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition):
     In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Java underwent significant updates and enhancements with the release of Java 2.
     J2SE indicated the second major version of the Java platform, which introduced significant improvements and new features over the original Java Development Kit
     The J2SE naming convention was used for several releases until it was eventually simplified to "Java SE."
3.Java SE (Java Platform, Standard Edition):
     The naming convention transitioned from "J2SE" to "Java SE" to reflect branding changes and to simplify the naming scheme.
     Java Platform refers to the entire Java ecosystem, which includes different editions such as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME.
     Standard Edition continues to signify that Java SE is the standard platform for general-purpose development.
     Java SE has been the standard name for the standard edition of Java since the mid-2000s.

->> Task 1:-
purpose of making constr as private: 
Making a constructor private is a technique used in object-oriented programming to control how instances of a class are created.

->> Task 2:-
can i make constr as final - impact:
Constructors cannot be declared as `final` in Java; however, making the entire class `final` prevents subclassing, indirectly securing constructors from being modified.

->> Task 3:-
if a keep int nearby constr - what happens:
The 'int' variable can be used within the constructor or the class for various purposes, such as calculations or storing values.
So, keeping 'int' nearby constructor it doesn't impact.

->> Task 4:-
class emp, in main meth - if a craete 5 obj - it should print 5 as o/p
if u creat 3 obj - it  should print 3 obj.

public class Emp {
    private static int objectCount = 0;

    public Emp() {
        objectCount++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
     
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            new Emp();
        }

        System.out.println(objectCount);
    }
}

output:- 
no of Emp object created: 5
